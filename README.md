### Hi there 👋

This is **Justin Huang**

I'm an **aspiring software engineer** from Los Angeles, California, and a Computer Science B.S. 2023 graduate from the University of California, San Diego (UCSD). I enjoy trying new areas of software development, whether it be web development trying new JS frameworks or machine learning. As I'm just getting started with my career, I hope to find out what area I would like to go into!
